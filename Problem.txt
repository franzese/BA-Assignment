Hello and thanks for applying to Blue Apron! As part of our interview process,
we'd like you to solve the problem below, and share your solution with us. This
problem is intended to take at most an hour to solve.

Please write a program that accepts an integer as a command line parameter, and
writes out a human-readable form of that integer. Your submission should
include the code you wrote to solve the problem, instructions for running your
program, and a console transcript showing that it works for at least the test
cases below.

Problem Statement:

Please write a program that accepts an integer as a command line parameter, and
writes out a human-readable form of that integer following the format described
below. Here's an example set of inputs and outputs that you should see from
your program:

$ ./example-solution 1
one
$ ./example-solution 17
seventeen
$ ./example-solution 1000018
one million eighteen
$ ./example-solution 123456789
one hundred twenty three million four hundred fifty six thousand seven hundred eighty nine

You may make these assumptions:

- Your program will only be passed well-formed inputs.
- All of your inputs will be integers.
- All of your inputs will have an absolute value under 2 billion.
- You can write your code in any language you choose.

Test Harness:

We've also provided a test harness to simplify running your example solution
with the test cases listed above. Use it as below:

$ ./harness.sh ./example-solution

That will run './example-solution' once per each of a set of test cases.
Feel free to add more test cases directly within that file if it makes your
life easier. If you do, please send us an updated copy of your harness.sh.
